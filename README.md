# random-numbers
This repo contains work which shows behaviour of random numbers.

I have used existing algorithms from online resources to generate bitmap and sound from the random data. I have tweaked them to integrate the API.

Sound Source : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioBuffer/getChannelData

- How to run the project 
 * Install dependencies using `npm install`
 * Run server using `node app.js`
